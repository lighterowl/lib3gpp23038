# `lib3gpp23038`

This is a set of functions to decode and encode the 7-bit GSM encoding, commonly known as [GSM 03.38](https://portal.3gpp.org/desktopmodules/Specifications/SpecificationDetails.aspx?specificationId=139), but these days defined in [3GPP TS 23.038](https://portal.3gpp.org/desktopmodules/Specifications/SpecificationDetails.aspx?specificationId=745).

As opposed to most other implementations, it supports the National Language Shift Tables as defined by the latest 3GPP specification at the time of writing.

The library is very small and meant to be integrated directly into your application. The supplied Makefile builds static and shared libraries only as an example.

# Legal

The licence of the library itself is available in `LICENCE.BSD`.

This software uses the Unicode Data File for mapping GSM 03.38 septets to Unicode characters, whose usage is governed under the following licence :
